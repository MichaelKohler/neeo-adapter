# NEEO Adapter

This is an adapter for the [Mozilla IoT gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org). There is some doubt on whether this adapter provides you any benefit.

Every macro has an action, which can be configured in the configuration. Using shortcuts in the NEEO app simplifies this as there will be a single GET HTTP request to be triggered.

## Setup
1. Set up the NEEO and add a device to it.
2. Add the NEEO information to the add-on configuration (Settings → Add-ons → Samsung TV NEEO Adapter → Configure.
3. You should now see the devce in the discovered devices.
